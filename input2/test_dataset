I looked for a leak, and rationed that I probably lost the oil because the ground is uneven and the rudimentary air hole in the oil plug lets oil out if it is pointed down hill.I added oil and worked the summer. At the end of the summer, same story, several quarts low. I added more oil and did not observe any leak while it was running, but did observe oil under the oil tank.This year I let it to my nephew who brought it back to my house and I put it in my garage. Voila, I saw an oil leak. Using a light I found the leak was a 1.5\" crack in the tank under the engine. I contacted Troy Bilt and told them what I told you. They will not warranty this work and told me to take it to a certified Troy Bilt repair center who quoted me nearly $800 to repair it.It is unfortunate this company does not support customers any better than this. Had I put this splitter on concrete two years ago, I would have found the leak while still under warranty. Even though I reported the leaking oil occurred during the warranty period, and only found the leak last week, they still won't warranty it. This is sad because Troy Bilt used to be something you could buy with confidence, but apparently not anymore. There are too many reports of inadequate welds and cracking tanks to recommend this splitter to anyone. Certainly the hydraulics still work good, but a leaking tank is just plain a bad idea.PaulWhen I researched log splitters, I settled on Troy-Bilt. I examined three models and chose the 33 ton splitter for its power, design and of course the reputation Troy-Bilt has. It comes with a Honda 8 HP engine, which on other slitters is an expensive upgrade.I read the review about it being shipped in parts. I ordered it and found the instructions to actually being helpful. Very well thought out and engineered, I put it together in about 4.5 hours, from the time I opened the crate to when I split the first log. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in a splitter and Amazon's price is the best on the market. I do recommend you have an assistant in putting it together, although one person can assemble it. Please note you also need 8 gallons of hydraulic fluid, not seven. You have to allow for the hoses, cylinder, and filter.I finally got a chance to use it on some 24-30 inch dried cottonwood logs. Impressive is all I have to say. Cottonwood tears, not splits and the family splitter couldn't touch this stuff. This splitter tore right threw it. When it hit nasty narly wood, the ram slowed down and continued on. The auto return feature also is a nice touch, it retracts while you get another piece. I have no regrets and look forward to taking it out in the spring to split the other 10 - 12 cords of hardwood. Right now there is 3 feet of snow on the ground so this will unfortunately have to wait until spring.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Amended I love it", "unixReviewTime": 1168732800, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2007", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

Simmons", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "After my long lasting Troy-Built push lawn mower died, I decided to buy a new one instead of getting it fixed.  After reading and researching on-line reviews for self-propelled lawn mowers it seemed they started in the price range around $300.  I had never had a self-propelled mower before.  But, the thought that if the wife or kids wanted to volunteer mowing our small yard a self-propelled mower would make it a more enjoyable experience.Several features I was looking for were: (1) Larger rear wheels, (2) Dependable engine, (3) Decent warranty, (4) Variable speed drive.  This mower has all these except the variable speed, which was not a problem for me since a little downward pressure on the handle will make the front wheels lift off and slow it down if needed.  With the larger rear wheels it seems to accomplish this and turning fairly well.  Also, this is the &lt;&lt; ONLY >> mower in this price range that has a dependable HONDA engine.  Looking at the reviews of more expensive mowers, the HONDA engines were a major selling point considering their ease of starting and dependability.  Some of the reviewers here at Amazon had indicated they had problems with that engine.  For the price to value features of this mower, I was willing to take a gamble.This last weekend it was delivered to our doorstep. The time it had taken since my old mower had died and it arrived had been a little over two weeks.  The lawn looked like a jungle and I was in a hurry to get it mowed before the neighbors started to complain.  Probably should have taken the time to read the instructions first before I assembled and started it though.To start off, there were only 4 bolt/wing nuts to make up as a previous reviewer had indicated. A mistake I made was not putting them in the correct direction since the grass collection bag interfered with the lower ones until I turned them 180 degrees about.  The instructions probably would have told me this if I had read them.  Also, the oil that came in the bottle was just a tad more than the capacity of the oil reservoir.  DON'T OVERFILL a gas engine.  Luckily, I checked the dip stick and saw that it was a little overfull after dumping the WHOLE bottle in.  I emptied a little oil out until the dipstick showed the correct level and continued the startup process by filling the gas tank.At that point I had to get the manual out to see a picture of which way the gas shut-off valve should be pointed.  Also, the spark plug wire had to be attached to the spark plug.  OK... ready to fire her up.  I turned the throttle to choke and gave a couple of tugs.  Nothing.  Huh, maybe I got a dud like the previous reviewer on Amazon.  A couple of more uneventful tugs and I realize the carburetor was flooded with gas.  So, I took the air filter off to let the carburetor air out.A few minutes passed and I replaced the air filter.  A couple of more tugs proved uneventful.  Wow, I stood back in thought looking at the new lifeless piece of equipment I had put so much hope and anticipation in.  Then it dawned on me, I may have to hold the top lever on the handle back when I was pulling the starting cord.  I turned the throttle to medium, held one hand on the \"kill switch\" lever on the handle and pulled the cord.  The engine burst to life!  If only I had taken the time to read all the instructions, I probably would have had a more successful startup.Nah, I knew what I was doing?  Besides I had a jungle to mow.  The jungle is gone now and I am very confident in this machine to perform well for me in the future.  I even went out a couple of days later while writing this review to test it to see if it started again.  I turned the throttle to \"choke\" and with one tug it started again.  Also, I noticed the throttle move on it's own down to a run position instead of the \"choke\" position after it started.  Very cool.Who knows maybe the wife and kids will use this thing?  If nothing else, they can start it for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What an Exceptional Value!", "unixReviewTime": 1123977600, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2005", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

Last summer I had just decided that gardening was out for the following season because it just broke my back leaning over or sitting on the ground (even with a pad) and I would be unable to move for days after being outside and working.  This past year I got proactive (I have a HUGE yard and a garden with tons of unwelcomed visitors).  I read the reviews here and decided on this rocker style chair.  SO HAPPY!Why:  It is insanely comfortable.  It has a nice water, dirt and and clumsy/rough behavior resistant fabric and construction, enough cushion, ergonomic rump molding and tilts plenty far forward, sideways and back (while feeling perfectly safe and stable) to get my garden work done.I did not once feel like I was going to tip or that it was going to fly out from under me.It is incredibly durable and very convenient.  It slid and ground into gravel all spring and summer at least 4 days per week for at least a half day at a session without showing any real wear (even on the bottom plastic).  I shoved weeders,scissors, clippers, hand trowels etc. into the pockets and they are in good condition.  No holes, frays... nothing.  There is also storage on the bottom so there is no need for lots of ups and downs (a bonus for the back).  It is light enough to carry by the handle (fabric in back) by one hand and carry a trash can in the other no problem.I also use it when washing the dog in the tub.I can garden day after day with this thing (with occasional stretches) and feel pretty darn good at the end of the day.Also - I was originally wanting a chair that had wheels.  So glad I did not go that way.  I would have been sinking in the dirt and grass, it would not have survived the gravel and this thing (although I am sure they do not recommend it) can scoot easily while still under you.

We purchased the Meco 9309W deluxe grill and could not be happier. In a nutshell, it is one of the best purchases I have ever made. The grill is small enough that we can store it in our apartment. It is unobtrusive and fits so easily in a spare corner that you wouldn't even know it was there. When we want to use it we simply put it out on our (very) small porch and can actually grill from inside. (Note: this is not an indoor grill.)Though the grill is electric, it cooks very much like a gas grill. Depending on what you are cooking, flareups and smoke can occur, but they make the food taste even better. Grease drips into the bottom of the grill, where there is a small hole for drainage. However, you need to put something beneath to catch the excess. I wish that the sellers would supply a small cup to catch the drippings, as there is a space for one, but a cup made of aluminum foil works just as well and is easy to clean up.The Meco grill is well made and cooks wonderfully. I use it several times a week (sometimes twice a day on weekends). It has plenty of space, so I can cook enough meat and vegetables for four or more people simultaneously. I have not yet used the rotisserie feature, but based on my experiences thus far I am sure it would produce great tasting food.For such a wonderful grill, the price was very reasonable; also, grilling has not increased our electric bill, so it seems comparable to using the oven/stove. I love the Meco grill and look forward to many more years with it.

It's set in 1986 in a former commune off the coast of New England.  Once there were 60 people living there, with hippie hopes and dreams.  But that was sixteen years before.  Now there are just two people left - Jack and his 16-year old daughter, Rose, played by Camilla Belle.  This father-daughter combo live their lonely lives in the midst of natural beauty and no modern conveniences. There's a deep bond between them.  But Jack is ill.  He has a heart condition and not long to live.  We can see it from his skeletal shape and the cave-in look of his features.Out of concern for his daughter, he invites a local woman named Kathleen with whom he has been having an affair, to come live with him. He even pays her money to do this.  She moves in with her two teenage sons.  One is a chubby and gay.  The other has a sense of feral evil about him.  They are shocked by the lack of modern conveniences but Kathleen is determined to make it work.What follows is a sad and somewhat warped look at the coming of age sexuality of Rose and an inevitable crisis that brings all the twisted emotions to the surface.  More than anything this film is a mood piece.  And the mood is one of despair, longing and unhappiness.Daniel Day-Lewis is an exceptionally talented actor and his is wonderful in this role as are all the other actors.  The cinematography is good too.  It's just the script that is too long and too weird.  I guess it got its point across though.  I left the theater thoroughly depressed.

{"reviewerID": "A1EG9GO3FMZXKB", "asin": "B0009PD3KU", "reviewerName": "Alessandro Abate", "helpful": [26, 46], "reviewText": "The 4x6 paper cartridge for my trusty old Canon printer broke the other day. Being an amateur photographer, I print a lot of photos and the majority of those prints are 4x6. Since my Canon I900D is a few years old, and not realizing (duh!) that I could get a replacement 4x6 cartridge until too late, I went into printer shopping mode. I figured I would go for a higher end photo printer, with archival inks and better color and resolution. After doing a significant amount of research I decided upon the Epson Stylus Photo R2400. One of the things I made sure to check was whether the R2400 could print 4x6 photos, it does. Once I confirmed this capability I started looking for a good deal. When I found a refurbished printer on Epson's site for two thirds of the retail price, I went for it. I realized that I couldn't return it and that it may be missing the bundled software and paper samples but it seemed like a good deal. Boy was I wrong!Epson Stylus Photo R2400The printer came after a few days in a massive box. I made room for the printer in my office and proceeded to install it. Right away I started having trouble. Since it was a new printer, I figured I just needed to become familiar with it and I began to play with it. I soon found out that it was very finicky. The printer and page setup settings had to be just right. I would print something, the job would be queued and sit there until the driver would give up and stop all jobs. If the right paper wasn't in the right tray no amount of coaxing would make the printer budge.I became acquainted with the various trays for the printer and their requirements. It turns out that the thicker papers have to be fed through the manual/roll tray in the back of the printer. I then tried to print some large panoramas. I took some Epson 8.3x23.4 paper that I purchased some time back and put it in the manual tray. I had to create a custom size for the paper in page setup. Apparently Epson has dropped this panorama paper and the size isn't available in the printer driver anymore. I cropped and resized a nice panorama to fit the special paper and I printed it, or I thought I did. Again the printer sat there looking dumb. The paper was in the right tray and by then I had managed to print on regular letter paper so I knew I could print. So what was happening? I tried again and again with the same results the job would start and then sit in the queue until the queue was stopped. Frustrated I figured I would try printing some 4x6 prints instead. I kept having the same problem.I tried troubleshooting the problem online. Epson has a troubleshooting guide on their support page that is supposed to walk you trough most problems. I have very bad luck with these guides. Since I have many years of experience using my computer and printing photos, I know the obvious things to try, making sure the printer is on and hooked up, making sure the software is installed, restart the computer and printer, check that the ink is installed properly, etcetera, etcetera, you get the idea. I didn't even get to try their guide; all I got was a blank page. I tried accessing the website with two other browsers, nada, no dice. I gave up trying the guide and sent tech support an email.While waiting for a response, I started searching online for problems with the printer. It was there that I found out that there was a newer version of the printer driver. The one shipped with the printer was for PowerPC Macs, not Intel Macs. I downloaded the driver and read the installation instructions. I would not be able to install the new driver over the old one. The instructions said to remove the old drivers first, restart the computer and install the new one. Why the new drivers are not included on the software CD is beyond me. One simple test could tell the installer what kind of Mac I own and it could choose the appropriate one saving the customer a lot of hassle. I didn't realize it then, but saving the customer from hassle isn't a big priority at Epson.I figured that the new driver would solve my problems, I was wrong. The large paper still refused to load and I could not produce any 4x6 prints from iPhoto. I then tried to print from Photoshop. Perhaps I'd have better luck there. I did manage to print 20 or 30 truly wonderful letter prints and some borderless 4x6 prints, but the larger paper sizes eluded me.The next day I tried the online tool again as I had not received a response from tech support. Most of the help was useless suggestions but I did come up with one solution. You can't just put paper in the manual tray, that would be too easy; you have to push the paper forcefully enough past where it rests naturally. Then you have to put pressure on the paper in the manual tray until the printer grips the paper, otherwise the printer, not finding any paper in the tray, gives up. To print on large paper you have to click on all the dialogs and then turn to the printer and push the paper. This sounds easier than it is. The printer is very large, over two feet wide and weighing 34 pounds. Unless you have a sizeable desk, this baby is not sitting next to your computer. You have to move to the printer and hold the paper before the printer gives up trying to find it. Luckily I have a wireless mouse and I could click on the print button while I was near the printer. It was thus that I finally managed to print on 13x19 watercolor paper.I now tried the panorama paper again. I managed to load it, hurray! But my joy was short lived; the printer left a 3 inch gap at the beginning of the paper and petered out slowly at the end leaving large uneven borders on what was to have been a borderless panorama. At least 20% of the paper was wasted, there was no joy in Mudville, I had struck out again.FrustratedIt was now when I started having another problem. Printouts started showing ink stains. Somehow ink had leaked on the printing path and was staining the paper as it made its way through the printer. I contacted tech support again. They responded a day later with the helpful suggestion of cleaning my print head. Since the stains were produced by ink left on the print path, cleaning the print heads would be useless. I pointed this out this to tech support in my reply. They responded by suggesting I run thick paper through the printer until the excess ink was wiped off. I grabbed some paper towels and cleaned as much of the paper path as I could. That seems to have fixed the stains.I gave up on the panoramas; I could live without that if need be. I had to be able to print 4x6 photos from iPhoto, that isn't an option. Although I could print borderless 4x6 prints from Photoshop, they had to be sent individually which is a big pain. iPhoto is very limited, but it is very useful for printing large batches of 4x6 prints, I wasn't going to give that up without a fight. I sent tech support an email asking for help in printing from iPhoto. A day later they replied with detailed instructions about cropping photos to the right size, selecting the right paper size in page setup and how to print photos from iPhoto. After taking a few deep breaths to calm down, I replied that I have extensive experience with iPhoto, and printing 4x6 prints that the problems wasn't my lack of familiarity with printing photos. A day later I received their reply telling me to reinstall the printer and resetting the printing system. I did as requested even though I had already reinstalled the printer driver with the Intel version appropriate for my Mac. I also reset the printing system, which erased all the print settings for all my printers, Epson or not. I lost settings that I use to make postscript files to distill into PDFs among other things, all of which have to be recreated from scratch. The fix allowed iPhoto to print on the Epson printer, but alas there was one more problem. The supposedly borderless prints had a 1/8th inch border on the top and left side. I sent tech support an email asking for help with this, days later I am still waiting for a response.To make matters worse, if that was conceivable, the printer driver is extremely difficult to navigate. Epson suggests using Epson branded paper in order to get the best quality prints. The specific names of the current Epson papers show up in the print dialog. What makes this incredibly infuriating is that the page setup determines what paper options available to you within the print dialog. This makes some sense and is well intentioned but very poorly executed. I bought some Epson Ultra 4x6 Premium Glossy Photo Paper to print my photos. Even though I tried every possible page setup setting for 4x6 paper there is no way to select Epson Premium Glossy Photo Paper in the print dialog. No matter what 4x6 option I select in page setup the Premium Glossy Photo Paper option is always grayed out. Only matte paper choices are available.I regret ever having bought this printer; it has been nothing short of a nightmare getting it to work. I have produced some great prints, but the amount of hassle I have to deal with to produce a print is extremely aggravating for a printer that retails for $800. I made the mistake of buying a refurbished printer from Epson that means I cannot return it and get my money back. I am stuck with this large, expensive paper weight. I am going to attempt to get it fixed or replaced. I was given the number for customer relations. I am reticent to call them because of the hassle involved. I am tired of dealing with this printer and most of all of dealing with Epson. Lemons appear even in the best manufacturing facilities. I can understand that there may be occasional problems with a product but aside from the defects of this printer Epson isn't set up to deal with customer's problems effectively. The tech support personnel have a limited script to follow and know little about the products they support, If that wasn't bad enough, they are also slow to respond. Their lack of troubleshooting skills and the long response times make it extremely frustrating to deal with Epson tech support. After this nightmare I am reticent to buy another Epson product again. I may be stuck with this boat anchor of a printer, this albatross and I may have to absorb the loss of $500 plus the cost of extra ink cartridges but Epson has lost a customer for life.Update: After much crying and gnashing of teeth I finally got a hold of an actual person at Epson. I spent three hours on the phone with two different tech support reps. We solved most of my remaining problems. The R2400 communicates with the computer and tells the printer driver what kind of ink is installed. If you have matte black (MK) ink, the driver will not allow you to select glossy paper. If you install the photo black (PK) ink, the driver then allows you to select glossy paper as well as matte paper. The problem is that this communication only happens when you launch the Epson Printer Utility, select your printer, click on status monitor and select the slot for matte/photo black ink. Until you force the driver to notice the change, it will not realize that the ink has changed and will not make the proper paper finishes available. You can switch ink cartridges back and forth as many times as you like, but until you manually check the ink levels for the MK/PK ink, the driver will not update the paper choices available to you in the print dialog.The problem with the borders was harder to solve and am not 100% happy with the solution. During the three hours we tested many different settings. I was not able to reproduce the 1/8th inch border on the top and left sides of the photo that was happening previously while printing from iPhoto. When printing on matte paper from iPhoto and Photoshop, we got perfect borderless prints. Printing on glossy paper was a different story, in both apps I keep getting a very thin, tapering white border at the bottom of the paper. Why it should happen in glossy paper and not on matte wasn't answered. The only way to remove the border was in Photoshop. In the Photoshop print dialog you have to select scale to fit media. You may need to change the percentage of scaling until the point where the image is enlarged enough to cover that border, maybe, if you get lucky. So far my experimentation has given me unpredictable results. Sometimes I get a thin sliver of a border on one side of the paper, sometimes I don't. It seems to me that borderless 4x6 prints are much easier on my Canon I900D. I guess I am going to have to keep it around for 4x6 duties and use Moby Dick, a.k.a. Epson Stylus Photo R2400 for larger photos.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "A Complete Nightmare", "unixReviewTime": 1191974400, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2007", "category": "Office_Product"}
